This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description

This Project uses Next.js(React), TypeScript & Tailwind.
Using OpenWeatherMap API I have created a page that takes a user input of a city and returns weather data.
I have also used the Route functionality for learning and created a another page /users which you can go to by changing URL or by clicking the link provided on the home page.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
